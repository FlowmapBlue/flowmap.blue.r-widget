WORK IN PROGRESS

This is a [Flowmap.blue](https://www.flowmap.blue/) widget for R.
It produces an interactive flow map representing numbers of movements between locations (origin-destination data).wn

You might also consider using this pure R flowmapping library: https://github.com/JohMast/flowmapper

As an alternative, you may also consider using R to populate a spreadsheet for publishing on [Flowmap.blue](https://www.flowmap.blue/)
as described in this [excellent blog post](https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2020/01/06/flow-maps/).

### Installation

From CRAN (when available):

```{r}
# install.packages("flowmapblue")
```

To install from GitHub you will need to install `remotes` if you don't have it yet:

```{r}
if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("FlowmapBlue/flowmapblue.R",
  force = TRUE, dependencies = TRUE)
```


### Quick example

Setup your Mapbox access token. You can obtain a free token by signing up at [Mapbox](https://account.mapbox.com/).

```{r}
#| eval: false
Sys.setenv(MAPBOX_API_TOKEN = "YOUR_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN")
```

```{r}
# load locations and flows for Switzerland
data(ch_locations)
data(ch_flows)

flowmap <- flowmapblue(
 ch_locations,
 ch_flows,
 mapboxAccessToken = Sys.getenv('MAPBOX_API_TOKEN'),
 clustering = TRUE,
 darkMode = TRUE,
 animation = FALSE
)

# view the map
flowmap
```


Here is a [nice intro blog post](https://www.paulamoraga.com/blog/2020-07-11-mobility.html) by Paula Moraga.

For more examples with time and date in flows data, as well as integration with Shiny, see the Quick Start vignette and documentation for the package functions.
